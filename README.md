# TanStack Table example

This is an update to my [React Table Example](https://github.com/ggascoigne/react-table-example) that was written using react-table@7 and Material UI.  This version used the rebranded [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8) (which is the new name for react-table since the release of v8).

There are a lot of simplifications in the interface for the new table library, I much prefer it.

Note that this repo is setup to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).  Both make the development experience much faster.

You can:

*  `pnpm i && pnpm start` to run locally.
